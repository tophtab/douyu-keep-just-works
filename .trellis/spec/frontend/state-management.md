# State Management

> How state is managed in this project.

---

## Overview

Docker WebUI state is currently split between:

- Vue-local state in `src/docker/webui-src/`
- Transitional legacy browser state under `src/docker/webui/app-state.js`
- Persisted configuration through Docker HTTP APIs

There is no dedicated server-state library such as Vue Query, and Pinia is not part of the current Docker WebUI stack.

## State Categories

- Local UI state: form fields, loading flags, dialogs, validation messages, cron previews.
- Shared page state during the transition: existing `DOUYU_KEEP_WEBUI_*` modules under `src/docker/webui/`.
- Persisted state: Docker config read/written through `/api/config`, `/api/cookie-source/*`, and related Express routes.

## When To Add Global State

Add a global store only when:

- multiple Vue components need the same mutable state,
- route/page changes should preserve background progress,
- or duplicated fetch/update logic appears in several components.

Until then, prefer component state plus small helper modules.

## Server And Persistence State

- Fetch Docker runtime data through the existing Express JSON APIs.
- Do not call Douyu directly from Vue components when the Docker backend already owns that boundary.
- Preserve backend cache/coalescing semantics; the browser should not add cooldowns that suppress needed local API refreshes.

## Common Mistakes

- Do not introduce Pinia before there is shared Vue-owned state.
- Do not duplicate the legacy `app-state.js` model into Vue without a migration plan.
- Do not silently convert failed API requests into valid empty UI state.
